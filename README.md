# Search-Log-Analysis
Bachelor Thesis Code

The code has been divided into three Jupyter Notebook Files to save time if the code should be run again.
It is necessary to run the code for the first time in this order, otherwise error messages will appear, as some variables have not yet been defined:

1) Search Log Analysis.ipynb
2) Clustering.ipynb
3) Relations.ipynb

In addition, CSV files are needed, which are best deposited in a separate data folder.
